# This code is for the ESL class of 2017, First half semester.
It contains several classisical methods for image classification on CIFAR-10 data and a test data teacher provided. 
We compare the performance of 
# k-Nearest Neighbor
# Multi-layer Perceptron(MLP)
# linear-SVM
# RBF-SVM
# Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)
on the task of CIFAR-10 image classification.
